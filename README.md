Hi, I am sharing PostgreSQL notes here

## My SQL commands 
- `Select count(amount) from payments` : It is used to count the number of rows in amount column in payments tab.

- `Select count(distinct amount) from payments` : It is used to count the number of distinct rows in amount column in payments tab
